These changes were condemned by the photography industry bodies, the National Union of Journalists and Editorial Photographers UK (EPUK) who said \"Alamy, it seems is trying to establish a perpetual and irrevocable contract with images that they have previously sold on our behalf at a time when this was not the case, which allows them to continue selling them even after the contract with the photographer has been terminated. ... The provision would last for the full term of copyright and we see it as unreasonably extensive.\" Alamy responded by stating that the changes only reflect the company work style and do not represent a significant shift. Their reply, in turn, was characterized by the documentary photographer and Alamy contributor David Hoffman as \"misleading and evasive\".\nCarol M. Highsmith sued Alamy in July 2016 for selling photographs without attribution she had donated to the Library of Congress. License Compliance Services, part of Alamy, had also sent an e-mail to the \"This is America!\" foundation, a foundation that was founded by Highsmith. The e-mail stated \"We have seen that an image or image(s) represented by Alamy has been used for online use by your company. According to Alamy\u2019s records your company doesn\u2019t have a valid license for use of the image(s).\" and demanded to pay a settlement fee of $120 for the infringement Highsmith was accused of. The photograph in question was not an infringement but an original work of authorship of Highsmith. Highsmith's claim was dismissed because she had signed away her copyrights, putting the photographs in the public domain."

        "wikipage": "The Zebra is an insurance comparison site with headquarters in Austin, Texas. It compares rates from over 200 insurance carriers.\nHistory.\nThe Zebra was co-founded by Joshua Dziabiak and Adam Lyons. Originally named Insurance Zebra, the company was initially started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while Lyons was living in a friend's basement and collecting unemployment checks.\nThe Zebra was part of the Alpha Lab Incubator Program run by the Pittsburgh venture capital firm Innovation Works, where it gained the attention of venture capital fund Silverton Partners.\nDuring a private beta period, the company showed testers 280,000 quotes.\nThe company received $1.5 million in seed funding from investors that included Mark Cuban, Silverton Partners, Floodgate, and Birchmere Labs. The funding was used to officially launch the website, with the company relocating to Austin, Texas.\nIn September 2013, having closed a $3 million extended seed round, the company launched to the public in both Texas and California, the two states with the most drivers. It initially offered quotes from 33 different insurers (approximately 90% of the market), requiring only a zip code and vehicle information to obtain a quote, although answering more questions, such as driving history, improved the accuracy of the quote. Companies included State Farm, Geico, and Allstate, as well as specialized insurers. The quotes were provided from a direct relationship that The Zebra had with the insurers, or through a rate manual from companies that it did not have a direct relationship with. The Zebra included real-time updating of quotes as users moved through the Q&amp;A sections, and allowed users to shop anonymously. In addition to providing quotes, the company lets drivers learn about companies\u2019 coverage and evaluate claims satisfaction.\nThe website allowed a more detailed quote for users who answered additional questions such as driving history. By the end of 2013, The Zebra was available to users in all 50 states, while increasing its platform to 204 companies that included 22 carriers such as Esurance and The General. It also received an additional $3 million of funding from its existing investors, adding investor Simon Nixon to the list of new investors.\nIn January 2016, The Zebra announced that it closed $17 million in Series A funding with investment from Cuban, Mike Maples Jr., Nixon, Silverton, and new investors Daher Capital and Ballast Point Ventures, bringing total funding to over $21 million. The company planned to use the additional funding to create educational tools that explain to drivers what\u2019s behind their rates, and how they can reduce rates while increasing coverage.\nIn 2017, The company announced a $40 million series B funding round, led by Accel Partners, bringing their fundraising total to $61.5 million. The company also brought on Keith Melnick as CEO. In 2017 the company added an \"Insurability Score\" which shows consumers to see what impacts their insurance risk, similar to a credit score for credit.\nIn 2018, Lyons left The Zebra and stepped aside from both day-to-day operations and his role as Chairman of the Board.\nThe Zebra has received national media attention. NBC Nightly News recommended The Zebra as a tool to compare car insurance quotes and save on rates.\nCompany recognition.\nThe company issued a joke which Time Magazine included in its Best April Fools\u2019 Pranks of 2014, and the company was named a Best Place to Work in Austin for four consecutive years from 2015 through 2019.\nFunding.\nIn September 2017, The Zebra received a $40 million Series B round of funding. In 2019, revenue grew almost 200% to nearly $37 million. In February 2020, the company announced a $38.5 million Series C funding round. Just like the Series B round, the Series C was led by Accel.\nBusiness model.\nThe Zebra offers a way for consumers to get real-time quotes from car insurance companies by filling out an online form. As the driver fills out the form, answering more questions about things like their age, driving record, and credit score, the quotes increase in accuracy. Because The Zebra itself is not an insurance agency, it\u2019s not biased toward sending customers to one company or another.\nAs of 2019, The Zebra provided over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers.\nResearch.\nThe Zebra analyzes more than 83 million car insurance rates to compile its annual State of Insurance report. The report covers topics including how much the average American is paying for their coverage, the states where rates are rising or falling, the most and least expensive cars to insure, how much a ticket raises drivers\u2019 insurance rates, and other variables that affect insurance rates such as marital status, age, credit score and education.\nThe Zebra has published additional reports on topics that impact the insurance industry, such as:\nLeadership.\nJoshua Dziabiak joined after the financing in 2013 as COO/CMO.\nKeith Melnick, previously President at Kayak, was named CEO of The Zebra in 2017.\nThe company\u2019s CTO is Meetesh Karia.\nAfter leading the company as CEO for 6 years, Lyons served as Chairman of the Board. He left in 2018, now serving on the board of CASA and as EIR at Bill Wood Ventures."

Throughout the fourth quarter of 2019, WeWork's estimated market capitalization fell in part due to numerous investigations of Neumann's behavior and business practices, such as engaging in nepotism. The company's unprofitable status and lack of clear strategy to achieve profitability in the future also contribute to continuing losses.\nIn 2018, WeWork's losses and revenue both doubled. According to the \"Financial Times\", the company lost $219,000 each hour of each day from March 2018 to March 2019.\nWeWork's August 24, 2019 SEC filing stated that the company faced substantial risk in the event of an economic downturn: \"...we have yet to experience a global economic downturn since founding our business,\" and \"an economic downturn or subsequent declines in market rents may result in increased member terminations and could adversely affect our results of operations,\" because the company had $47 billion of future lease obligations and only $4 billion of future lease commitments. In the third quarter of 2019, during which the IPO failed, WeWork had a negative cash flow of $1.2 billion. During 2020, the company left 66 locations and re-negotiated lower rent, deferrals, or other lease changes at more than 150 others. These actions, combined with selling off some acquisitions, closing some business lines, eliminating thousands of jobs and cutting other expenses, reduced negative free cash flow to $517 million in the third quarter 2020. WeWork ended that quarter with 542,000 memberships across its 859 locations.\nLawsuits.\nFormer executives sue WeWork.\nAs of June 2019, three former executives were at various stages of suing WeWork, one alleging age discrimination, one alleging sexual harassment claims that resulted in retaliation, and one alleging retaliation for filing a complaint that women were paid less.\nIn October 2019, Medina Bardhi, the former chief of staff for Adam Neumann, sued The We Company over various allegations including a gender pay gap, marijuana use by company executives, and pregnancy discrimination.\nIn February 2020, Ayesha Whyte, former director of employee relations, sued WeWork for gender and race discrimination, \"saying she was promised a well-paying job that never materialized, all while less-qualified white people were promoted.\"\nOn July 8, 2020, former WeWork stock plan administrator, Diane Allen, and former head of diversity &amp; inclusion, Christopher Clermont, filed separate complaints against WeWork. Both alleged race discrimination, while Allen also alleged gender discrimination and lack of action over a sexual harassment claim.\nWeWork sues SoftBank.\nIn April 2020, SoftBank, the main shareholder of WeWork, pulled its $3 billion tender offer to buy shares directly from some of WeWork's major stockholders. SoftBank cited failure by WeWork to obtain certain regulatory approvals, new criminal and civil investigations, and government actions due to the COVID-19 pandemic as reasons for withdrawing the offer. In turn, WeWork's special committee of the board of directors sued SoftBank over the withdrawal of the shares purchase.\nOn May 4, 2020, former CEO Adam Neumann separately sued SoftBank for withdrawing the $3 billion tender offer.\nIn popular culture.\nIn January 2021, Apple TV+ announced a new show called \"WeCrashed\" that follows the launching and fall of WeWork.
